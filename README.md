# Hello World 👋

I like experiment with new technologies, and build out things just to understand how they work.
 
I’m driven by curiosity. I deep dive into:  
- AI research and model behavior  
- System design  
- Prompt engineering and agent strategies  
- How people use technology in the real world  
- Random topics that pull me in
